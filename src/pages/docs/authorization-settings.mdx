### Policies Properties

## Using Non-Scope Policy Types
At the moment, only scope policies can be scaffolded out in a Wrapt project. With that said, as with any Wrapt project, you can absolutely update it to use additional policies and [authorize by role](https://jakeydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security/authorization/roles.html)
or [by a claim](https://jakeydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security/authorization/claims.html) as well. If you're adding this manually, make sure you [hit all the right places](/docs/all-about-auth-in-dotnet-core#how-does-wrapt-set-up-auth).

As always, if there enough of a need for these to be supported out of the box, please feel free to submit a feature request on GitHub.

## Learn More About Setting Up Auth
Authentication and Authorization are a very complex domain to work with. I've made an effort to [consolidate my learning around auth](/docs/all-about-auth-in-dotnet-core) to help myself and others if you'd like to check it out.  

## Authorization Settings Example
```yaml
AuthorizationSettings:
  Policies:
    - Name: CanReadPatients
      PolicyType: scope
      PolicyValue: patients.read
      EndpointEntities:
        - EntityName: Patient
          RestrictedEndpoints:
            - GetList
            - GetRecord
    - Name: CanAddPatients
      PolicyType: scope
      PolicyValue: patients.add
      EndpointEntities:
        - EntityName: Patient
          RestrictedEndpoints:
            - AddRecord
    - Name: CanDeletePatients
      PolicyType: scope
      PolicyValue: patients.delete
      EndpointEntities:
        - EntityName: Patient
          RestrictedEndpoints:
            - DeleteRecord
    - Name: CanUpdatePatients
      PolicyType: scope
      PolicyValue: patients.update
      EndpointEntities:
        - EntityName: Patient
          RestrictedEndpoints:
            - UpdateRecord
            - UpdatePartial
```
