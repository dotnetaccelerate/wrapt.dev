## Swagger <FileRequirementPill padLeft={"sm"} type={"optional"} />

If desired, you can add a basic swagger configuration using the `SwaggerConfig` option. This will scaffold out a bare bones swagger page using [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore#getting-started), which you can update to use any additional features you wish. 

Of note, you can scaffold out detailed swagger comments for each of your endpoints using the [AddSwaggerComments property](#AddSwaggerComments-property).

To get to your swagger page, you can go to `/swagger`.

## Swagger Properties

| Name        | Required | Description                          | Default |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Title       | Yes      | The title of the swagger document    | *None*  |
| Description | No       | The description for your swagger doc | *None*  |
| ApiContact  | No       | The primary contact for the API      | *None*  |
| SwaggerEndpointUrl  | No       | The url to use for the swagger documentation.     | /swagger/v1/swagger.json  |
| SwaggerEndpointName  | No       | The name to use on the main swagger documentation page.     | *None*  |
| LicenseName | No       | The name of the license on the swagger documentation. | *None*  |
| LicenseUrl | No       | The url of the license on the swagger documentation. | *None*  |
| AddSwaggerComments | No       | Determines whether or not Craftsman should scaffold out detailed swagger comments for each endpoint. Please see the notes below for information on this usage. | false  |

### ApiContact Properties

| Name  | Required | Description                 | Default |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| Name  | No       | The name of the contact     | *None*  |
| Email | No       | The email of the contact    | *None*  |
| Url   | No       | The website for the contact | *None*  |

### AddSwaggerComments Property
If set to `true`, Craftsman will scaffold out detailed comments on using each endpoint. The largest impact is on the details of using the GET list/collection endpoint and will discuss how to use pagination, filters, and sorting. 

#### Manual Intervention Required
If you are using this setting, you will have to manually add `XML documentation` and `1591` exception suppression to your WebApi project. This is not done for you automatically because of the current absolute path 
requirement. I don't want to presume this path for you and it could affect your deployment strategies, so this must be done manually to whatever specifications meet your needs. There are discussions on 
creating a more flexible xml documentation target in [this github issue](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/368) if you'd like to track the progress.

To implement these updates:

1) Right click the `WebApi` project and select `Properties`

2) Go to the `Build` tab

3) Check the `XML Documentation` box and, if desired, update the url

4) Add the `1591` code to the suppression warnings input. Generally this would make your input read as `1701;1702;1591;`

5) If you'd like to  add comments to the parameters directly (these are not scaffolded for you in Craftsman), you'll need to do the same for the `Application` project as well
