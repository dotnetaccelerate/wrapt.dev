## Git
By default, Wrapt will do some initial git setup for you (`git init`, `git add -a`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, and add a `.gitignore`). 

If you'd like to skip this and do it yourself, you can set the `AddGit` option to `false` on the base level.

```yaml
AddGit: false
```

## Git Example
In this example we have a `yaml` file that's setting up an API for a Vet Clinic. You can see that `AddGit` is set to false, so no git setup will be performed. 

```yaml
SolutionName: VetClinic.Api
Entities:
#entity details
AddGit: false
```
