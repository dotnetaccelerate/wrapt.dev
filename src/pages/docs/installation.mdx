## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019 16.8.0+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [.Net 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0) 

## Getting Started
1. Install the `Craftsman` tool globally. This is going to be the workhorse behind all of our commands. 

   ```shell
   dotnet tool install -g craftsman
   ```

2. Run any of the below for a list of available commands

   ```shell
   craftsman 
   craftsman list
   craftsman -h
   craftsman --help
   ```

3. That's it! Now let's look at [an example](/docs/tutorial) to see it in action.

## Updating Craftsman
To update to the latest version of Craftsman, you can run:
```shell
dotnet tool update -g craftsman
```
