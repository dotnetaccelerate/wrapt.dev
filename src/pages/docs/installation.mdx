## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019 16.8.0+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [.Net 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0) 

## Getting Started

1. To start, you'll need install the [Foundation API Template](https://github.com/pdevito3/foundation.api). This is the base template that our CLI will use when creating a new Web API.

   ```shell
   dotnet new -i foundation.api
   ```

   > Note that on the off chance that you have another dotnet template on your machine with a `foundation` short name, you will need to uninstall that template before using 
   a `craftsman new:api` command. To get the uninstall command run `dotnet new -u` and find the uninstall command listed for your foundation template.

2. Install the `Craftsman` tool globally. This is going to be the workhorse behind all of our commands. 

   ```shell
   dotnet tool install -g craftsman
   ```

3. Run any of the below for a list of available commands

   ```shell
   craftsman 
   craftsman list
   craftsman -h
   craftsman --help
   ```

4. That's it! Now let's look at [an example](/docs/tutorial) to see it in action.

## Staying Up to Date
To keep up to date with the latest Craftsman capabilities, first update the Foundation template.
```shell
dotnet new foundation.api --update-apply
```

Then you can update Craftsman:
```shell
dotnet tool update -g craftsman
```
