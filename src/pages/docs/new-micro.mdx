## New Microservice Example

### New Microservice Template File

To get things started, you're going to need to scaffold out what you want your initial Microservice configuration to look like in a `yaml` or `json` file. 

Don't feel pressured to get this exactly correct from the get go. **This file is NOT meant to be a concrete implementation of your Microservice**, just a starting point that you can build on over time. 

So what's this file look like? For a full list of the configuration option details, you can go to the [microservice template page](/docs/micro-template), but let's go over a basic `yaml` example here:

First, you need to start with a name for your project:

```yaml
SolutionName: MicroCarbonKitchen
```

Then, let's lay out the details for each of our microservices. This is a very similar setup to the `new:api` command and has details for everything from the database that you want to use, the entities for the microservice, and more:

```yaml
SolutionName: MicroCarbonKitchen
Microservices:
- ProjectFolderName: Recipes
  Port: 5467
  DbContext:
    ContextName: RecipeDbContext
    DatabaseName: Recipe
    Provider: SqlServer
  Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Properties:
    - Name: RecipeId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Title
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Directions
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: RecipeSourceLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Description
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: ImageLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
  SwaggerConfig:
    Title: CarbonKitchen Recipe

  Environments:

    ConnectionString: "Data Source=localhost\\SqlExpress;Initial Catalog=QaDb;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
    ProfileName: QA
  - EnvironmentName: Development
    Authority: https://localhost:5010
    Audience: recipes
    AuthorizationUrl: https://localhost:5010/connect/authorize
    TokenUrl: https://localhost:5010/connect/token
  - EnvironmentName: Prod
    ConnectionString: "Data Source=localhost\\SqlExpress;Initial Catalog=ProdDb;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
    ProfileName: Prod
```

Next, I'm going to establish what gateways I want in my project. This could just be one central gateway or you could create multiple gateways to serve as backends for frontends (BFFs).

```yaml
SolutionName: MicroCarbonKitchen
Microservices:
- ProjectFolderName: Recipes
  Port: 5467
  DbContext:
    ContextName: RecipeDbContext
    DatabaseName: Recipe
    Provider: SqlServer
  Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Properties:
    - Name: RecipeId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Title
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Directions
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: RecipeSourceLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Description
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: ImageLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true

```

And that's it! Now that we've laid out what we want our microservice to look like, let's [make it](#using-the-new-micro-command)!

### Using the New Micro Command

1. To actually create your microservices, we'll want to `cd` into whatever directory you want to add your project to:

  ```shell
  cd C:\MyFull\RepoPath\Here
  ```

2. Then, let's make sure that your `Craftsman` CLI is up to date:

  ```shell
  dotnet tool update -g craftsman
  ```

3. Then you just need to add your `yaml` or `json` path to your `craftsman new:micro` command:

  ```shell
  craftsman new:micro C:\Users\Paul\Documents\ApiConfigs\MicroCarbonKitchen.yaml
  ```

4. Once you've run this command, your new project should be ready to go!
