## What are We Building?
Let's say that we want to create an application to manage recipes. We're going to call it `CarbonKitchen` and it 
should start out by storing recipes and their associated ingredients. 

## Creating a Template File
As we discussed in [the basics](/docs/how-it-works#the-basics), we need to start out by building a barebones `yaml` 
or `json` file to lay out what we want our API to look like. You can find the details for each of these properties we're 
working with in the `Template File` section of the docs, but let's start building it out.

### Solution and Database Setup
We're going to start out by creating a new `yaml` file and adding a [SolutionName](/docs/solution-name) of 
'CarbonKitchen.Api' and a basic [DbContext](/docs/db-context) that points to SqlServer.

```yaml
SolutionName: CarbonKitchen.Api
DbContext:
 ContextName: CarbonKitchenDbContext
 DatabaseName: CarbonKitchen
 Provider: SqlServer
```

### Entity Setup
Then I'm going to add in my 'Recipe' and 'Ingredient' [Entities](/docs/entities) with a variety of 
properties based on my requirements. Be sure to check the [entity](/docs/entities#entity-properties) to 
see what's required and what defaults are used, but it's built to be as minimal as possible.

```yaml
SolutionName: CarbonKitchen.Api
DbContext:
 ContextName: CarbonKitchenDbContext
 DatabaseName: CarbonKitchen
 Provider: SqlServer
Entities:
- Name: Recipe
  Properties:
  - Name: RecipeId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Title
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Directions
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: RecipeSourceLink
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Description
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: ImageLink
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
- Name: Ingredient
  Properties:
  - Name: IngredientId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: RecipeId
    Type: int?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Name
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Unit
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Amount
    Type: double?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
```

### Optional Environment and Swagger Setup
Now I'm going to add in a few environments as well as some Swagger documentation. Both of these are optional, but good to have.
```yaml
SolutionName: CleanCarbonKitchen.Api
DbContext:
 ContextName: CarbonKitchenDbContext
 DatabaseName: CarbonKitchen
 Provider: SqlServer

  Properties:
  - Name: RecipeId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Title
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Directions
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: RecipeSourceLink
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Description
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true

    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
- Name: Ingredient
  Properties:
  - Name: IngredientId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: RecipeId
    Type: int?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Name
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Unit
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Amount
    Type: double?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
- Name: ShoppingListItem
  Properties:
  - Name: ShoppingListItemId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Amount
    Type: double?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Name
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Category
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Unit
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Acquired
    Type: bool?
    DefaultValue: false
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Hidden
    Type: bool?
    DefaultValue: false
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: ShoppingListId
    Type: int?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
Environments:
  - EnvironmentName: Production
    ConnectionString: "Data Source=myprodserver;Initial Catalog=CarbonKitchen;Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    ProfileName: Prod
  - EnvironmentName: Qa
    ConnectionString: "Data Source=myqaserver;Initial Catalog=CarbonKitchen;Integrated Security=True;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    ProfileName: Qa
SwaggerConfig:
  Title: Carbon Kitchen
  Description: Our API uses a REST based design, leverages the JSON data format, and relies upon HTTPS for transport. We respond with meaningful HTTP response codes and if an error occurs, we include error details in the response body. API Documentation is at carbonkitchen.com/dev/docs
  ApiContact: 
    Name: Carbon Kitchen
    Email: devsupport@CarbonKitchen.com
    Url: https://www.carbonkitchen.com
```

## Creating a New API
Now that we've put together our basic API layout, let's actually build our API. To start, make sure you've followed the [install instructions](/docs/installation).
Then, open Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, etc. and `cd` to whatever directory you want to create your project repository in. Finally, we can literally just run [one command](/docs/new-api):

```shell
craftsman new:api C:\Users\Paul\Documents\WraptTemplates\NewCarbonKitchen.yaml
```

> Note that the filepath here should match wherever you saved your yaml file.

Once that's done, Craftsman will have added an entire API for you in whatever directory you ran this in. For details on the project architecture and organization you can go [here](/docs/project-organization).

### Using Your API 
Now you can `cd` into your project directory and run `dotnet run --project webapi` and your API is up and running with no boilerplate in sight üëè

## Adding a New Entity
But hold on, we have this existing project, but what if we wanted to create a new entity to capture shopping list items so that we can add ingredients we need for our grocery outing? 
All we need to do is create another `yaml` or `json` file that describes this new entity. Something like this:

```yaml
Entities:
- Name: ShoppingListItem
  Properties:
  - Name: ShoppingListItemId
    IsPrimaryKey: true
    Type: int
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Amount
    Type: double?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Name
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Category
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Unit
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
```

Then, we can add that entity to our project using the [add:entity command](/docs/add-entity):

```shell
craftsman add:entity C:\Users\Paul\Documents\WraptTemplates\ShoppingListEntity.yaml
```

## Adding a New Property
Now what if we wanted to add a new property to determine whether or not that shopping list item has been acquired and put into our cart. There's [a command](/docs/add-entity-property) for that too! And we 
don't even need a file this time!

Let's say we wanted to add a nullable boolean called 'Acquired' that can be filtered and sorted. We could do something like this:

```shell
craftsman add:property --entity ShoppingListItem --name Acquired --type bool? --filter true -sort true
```

We could also use shorthand and do something like this:
```shell
craftsman add:property -e ShoppingListItem -n Acquired -t bool? -f true -s true
```

## Customization
Great! Now I have my API, but I want to add some custom business logic. Maybe I want to do some special operation in the recipe repository when I'm adding something new or add another 
endpoint to manage ingredients in batch. This is all completely doable! For details, see the page on [customizing Wrapt projects](/docs/customizing-wrapt-projects).
