description: An overview of the Wrapt philosphy and how things actually work

## The Basics
The whole idea for Wrapt started out with a goal of eliminating as much of the tedious and repetetive work that comes with 
setting up a Web API, so that myself and other developers could ***focus on actually building their app and working on high value, 
business specific, features.***

To accomplish this, I put together a custom CLI called Craftsman. Craftsman is the workhorse behind Wrapt that can not 
only scaffold out an entire Web API with just a simple `yaml` or `json` file, but can also run commands that allow us 
to continue to maintain that project after it's been built. 


## But What is Wrapt?
Wrapt is a simple framework built on .NET that we can use to quickly scaffold out and maintain our projects. 

At the end of the day, all this really means is that ***a Wrapt project is just a .NET solution that's organized in a 
particular way so that Craftsman knows how to add all your boilerplate for you.*** That's it.
