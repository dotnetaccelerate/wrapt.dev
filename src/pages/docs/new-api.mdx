## New Api Example

### New API Config File

To get things started, you're going to need to scaffold out what you want your initial API configuration to look like in a `yaml` or `json` file. 

Don't feel pressured to get this exactly correct from the get go. **This file is NOT meant to be a concrete implementation of your API**, just a starting point that you can build on over time. 

So what's this file look like? For a full list of the configuration option details, you can go [to the configuration file options](#api-configuration-file-options), but let's go over a basic `yaml` example:

First, you need to start with a name for your API:

```yaml
SolutionName: VetClinic.Api
```

Then, let's lay out the database context:

```yaml
SolutionName: VetClinic.Api
DbContext:
  ContextName: VetClinicContext
  DatabaseName: VetClinic
  Provider: SqlServer
```

Then, we'll add an entity (check out the [full list](/docs/entities) of entity options):

```yaml
SolutionName: VetClinic.Api
DbContext:
  ContextName: VetClinicContext
  DatabaseName: VetClinic
  Provider: SqlServer
Entities:
  - Name: Pet
    Properties:
    - Name: PetId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: false
    - Name: Name
      Type: string
      CanFilter: false
    - Name: Type
      Type: string
      CanFilter: false
      CanSort: true
```

Note that this is a list, so we can add more than one entity if we want:

```yaml
SolutionName: VetClinic.Api
DbContext:
  ContextName: VetClinicContext
  DatabaseName: VetClinic
  Provider: SqlServer
Entities:
  - Name: Pet
    Properties:
    - Name: PetId
      IsPrimaryKey: true
      Type: int
      CanFilter: false
    - Name: Name
      Type: string
      CanFilter: false
    - Name: Type
      Type: string
      CanFilter: false
      CanSort: true
  - Name: City
    Plural: Cities
    Properties:
    - Name: CityId
      CanManipulate: false
      Type: int
      CanFilter: true
    - Name: Name
      Type: string
      CanFilter: false  
```

And that's it! Now that we've laid out what we want our API to look like, let's [make it](#using-the-command)!

### Using the New Api Command

1. To actually create your API, we'll want to `cd` into whatever directory you want to add your project to:

  ```shell
  cd C:\MyFull\RepoPath\Here
  ```

2. Then, let's make sure that your `Foundation.Api` template and `Craftsman` CLI are up to date:

  ```shell
  dotnet new foundation.api --update-apply
  dotnet tool update -g craftsman
  ```

3. Then you just need to add your `yaml` or `json` path to your `craftsman new:api` command:

  ```shell
  craftsman new:api C:\Users\Paul\Documents\ApiConfigs\VetClinic.yaml
  ```

4. Once you've run this command, your API should be ready to go!
