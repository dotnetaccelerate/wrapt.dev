## Clean Architecture
Instead of making you learn some custom directory structure, Wrapt projects are organized using the well known and maintainable `Clean Architecture` format. If you are not familiar with this strcuture, 
there are some great resources on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joNTQy-KXiU), [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and 
[here](https://www.codewithmukesh.com/blog/onion-architecture-in-aspnet-core/). 

In short, `Clean Architecture` breaks your project up into logical layers like below. If you want to add something and you're not seeing it here, but think it should be, feel free to 
submit a ticket on github for it to be added.

### Core
The core layer is split into two projects, the `Application` and `Domain` layers. 

The `Domain` project is pretty simple and will capture all of the entities and items directly related to that. This layer should never depend on any other project.

The `Application` project is meant to abstract out our specific business rules for our application. It is dependent on the `Domain` layer, but has no dependencies on 
any other layer or project. This layer defines our interfaces, DTOs, Enums, Exceptions, Mapping Profiles, Validators, Specifications, and Wrappers that can be used by our external layers.


### Infrastructure
Our infrastructure layer is used for all of our external communication requirements (e.g. database communication). For more control, this layer is split into a `Persistence` 
project as well as a `Shared` project. Additional layers like `Auth`, `Web Api Clients`, `File System Accessors`, `Logging Adapters`, and `Email/SMS Sending` can also be added here.

The `Persistence` project will capture our application specific database configuration. The `Shared` project will capture any external service requirements that 
we may need across our infrastructure layer (e.g. DateTimeService).


### API
Finally, we have our API layer. This is where our `WebApi` project will live to provide us access to our API endpoints. This layer depends on both the `Core` and `Infrastructure` layers, 
however, the dependency on `Infrastructure` is only to support dependency injection. Therefore only `Startup` classes should reference `Infrastructure`.
